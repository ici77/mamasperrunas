**IMPORTANT:** This library doesn't validate the token, any well-formed JWT can be decoded. You should validate the token in your server-side logic by using something like [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt), [koa-jwt](https://github.com/stiang/koa-jwt), [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer), etc.

## Getting started

### Installation
=======
## **jwt-decode** is a small browser library that helps decoding JWTs token which are Base64Url encoded.

**IMPORTANT:** This library doesn't validate the token, any well formed JWT can be decoded. You should validate the token in your server-side logic by using something like [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt), [koa-jwt](https://github.com/stiang/koa-jwt), [Owin Bearer JWT](https://github.com/michaelnoonan/Auth0-Owin-JwtBearerAuthentication), etc.

---

**Warning: When upgrading from version `2` to `3`, there's a potentially breaking change**

If you've previously imported the library as `import * as jwt_decode from 'jwt-decode'`, you'll have to change your import to `import jwt_decode from 'jwt-decode';`.

Install with NPM or Yarn.

Run `npm install jwt-decode` or `yarn add jwt-decode` to install the library.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Usage

```js
import { jwtDecode } from "jwt-decode";

const token = "eyJ0eXAiO.../// jwt token";
const decoded = jwtDecode(token);
=======
## Usage

```javascript
import jwt_decode from "jwt-decode";

var token = "eyJ0eXAiO.../// jwt token";
var decoded = jwt_decode(token);
>>>>>>> 460181305 (Subida inicial del frontend)

console.log(decoded);

/* prints:
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * { 
 *   foo: "bar",
 *   exp: 1393286893,
 *   iat: 1393268893  
 * }
 */

// decode header by passing in options (useful for when you need `kid` to verify a JWT):
const decodedHeader = jwtDecode(token, { header: true });
console.log(decodedHeader);

/* prints:
 * { 
 *   typ: "JWT",
 *   alg: "HS256" 
 * }
 */
```

**Note:** A falsy or malformed token will throw an `InvalidTokenError` error; see below for more information on specific errors.

## Errors

This library works with valid JSON web tokens. The basic format of these token is
```
[part1].[part2].[part3]
```
All parts are supposed to be valid base64 (url) encoded json.
Depending on the `{ header: <option> }` option it will decode part 1 (only if header: true is specified) or part 2 (default)

Not adhering to the format will result in a `InvalidTokenError` with one of the following messages:

- `Invalid token specified: must be a string` => the token passed was not a string, this library only works on strings. 
- `Invalid token specified: missing part #` => this probably means you are missing a dot (`.`) in the token 
- `Invalid token specified: invalid base64 for part #` => the part could not be base64 decoded (the message should contain the error the base64 decoder gave)
- `Invalid token specified: invalid json for part #` => the part was correctly base64 decoded, however, the decoded value was not valid JSON (the message should contain the error the JSON parser gave)

#### Use with TypeScript

The return type of the `jwtDecode` function is determined by the `header` property of the object passed as the second argument. If omitted (or set to false), it'll use `JwtPayload`, when true it will use `JwtHeader`. 
If needed, you can specify what the expected return type should be by passing a type argument to the `jwtDecode` function.

You can extend both `JwtHeader` and `JwtPayload` to include non-standard claims or properties.

```typescript
import { jwtDecode } from "jwt-decode";

const token = "eyJhsw5c";
const decoded = jwtDecode<JwtPayload>(token); // Returns with the JwtPayload type
```

#### Use as a CommonJS package

```javascript
const { jwtDecode } = require('jwt-decode');
...
```

#### Include with a script tag

Copy the file `jwt-decode.js` from the root of the `build/esm` folder to your project somewhere, then import `jwtDecode` from it inside a script tag that's marked with `type="module"`:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { jwtDecode } from "/path/to/jwt-decode.js";

  const token = "eyJhsw5c";
  const decoded = jwtDecode(token);
</script>
```

## Use as a CommonJS package

```javascript
const jwt_decode = require('jwt-decode');
...
```

## Include with a script tag

Copy the file `jwt-decode.js` from the `build/` folder to your project somewhere, then include like so:

```html
<script src="jwt-decode.js"></script>
```

## Older versions

If you want to use the library trough Bower, an HTML import, use [version `v2.2.0`](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-decode/tree/v2.2.0). It has the same functionality.

## Develop

Run `npm run dev`, this will fire up a browser and watch the `/lib` folder.
